## Professional Journey

I started my career as a Founder attempting to build a startup. I have worked for companies in Lagos and London, like PearWheel as a Software Engineer and Zumvie, as a Technical Content Manager. Currently, I am an Independent DevRel (Developer Relations Engineer) and Technical Writer working with companies like Spacelift, Mia-Platform, and mvpGrow. And I am also building a Cloud Native/DevOps learning platform called EverythingDevOps (https://everythingdevops.dev/).

## Professional Interests

I am passionate about helping developers adopt cloud native technologies and build scalable, reliable, and secure applications. I am also a strong advocate for open source software (even though I don’t contribute as much I would like 😆) and believe that it is essential for innovation.

<p align="center"> I WANT TO BE THE BEST DEVELOPER ADVOCATE EVER!!! </p> 

## Personal Interests
Aside from the world of software, I enjoy watching and playing football (soccer), listening to good music, traveling (I love airports but dread them too 😆), and having fun in my own way.
