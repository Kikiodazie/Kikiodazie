## 👨🏿‍🚀 Professional Journey

I started my career as a Founder attempting to build a startup. I have worked for companies in Lagos and London, like PearWheel as a Software Engineer and Zumvie as a Technical Content Manager. Currently, I am an Independent DevRel (Developer Relations Engineer) and Technical Writer working with companies like Spacelift, Mia-Platform, and mvpGrow. And I am also building a Cloud Native/DevOps learning platform called [EverythingDevOps](https://everythingdevops.dev/).

PS: I studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering in University (College)

## 👨🏿‍🔬 Professional Interests

I am passionate about helping developers adopt cloud native technologies and build scalable, reliable, and secure applications. I am also a strong advocate for open source software (even though I don’t contribute as much I would like 😆) and believe that it is essential for innovation.

<h2 align="center">  <strong>I WANT TO BE THE BEST DEVELOPER ADVOCATE EVER!!!  </strong></h2> 

## 🏃🏿 Personal Interests
Aside from the world of software, I enjoy watching and playing football (soccer), listening to good music, traveling (I love airports but dread them too 😆), and having fun in my own way.

## Community 
I am active in the Cloud Native and DevOps community as:

- KCD Organizer
- AWS Community Builder for the Containers Category
- Volunteer of Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE) Cloud Native Track

## Certifications
I think certificates are valuable in the cloud native world. And this is because of the knowledge you fill while prepping. Below are some certificates I have earned:

- [AWS Solutions Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/3dd05053-5d73-4802-baec-e48e9ffe4f95/public_url)
